# 12barsongset

This is a React PWA created to show a reordable list of songs.

Every song has its own route and it is possible to increase and decrease lyrics size. The text automatically diplays on columns based on the space available in the viewport.

This app has been created to be used during live sets on a tablet fixed to the mic stand.
